# Common Issues & Troubleshooting

  * Virtual decks playing in reverse? Switch the left and right RCA plugs over.
  * Getting pops, clicks and xruns? Try increasing your buffer size.
  * xwax not working with your CD players? Turn off key lock/master tempo.
  * [Diagnosing the Scope Views](http://serato.com/articles/scratchlive/2781/diagnosing-the-scope-views) - A useful article from Serato on using the scope display. Helpful if your timecode's performance is less than optimal.
  * Scope signal is square? You might have input distortion if your CD player output is too loud for your audio interface input. If the audio interface has a fixed input gain, you can lower the amplitude of the timecode WAV file in a program such as Audacity and burn a new timecode CD.
  * [TTF DejaVu fonts not found](/ttf_dejavu_fonts_not_found)

# xwax Community

xwax is not only a project, but also a lively community!

  * Check out [our works](/our_works) and list your creations too!
  * Get in touch with the developers with your feedback and bug reports via the [xwax-devel mailing list.](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/xwax-devel)
  * You can also chat with or ask advice from the xwax community live in the IRC channel #xwax on [irc.freenode.net](http://freenode.net/). Best practice is to ask your question and then leave your IRC client running while you do something else as it may be some time before someone replies.
