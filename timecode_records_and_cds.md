**xwax** requires a special media source embedded with a special "tone", known as a *timecode*, to send a signal to xwax telling it how to manipulate the audio file.

## Vinyl Media

Current generation Traktor Scratch records **are not** supported.

### Discontinued Vinyl Media

The following records are still supported by xwax but are no longer available in stores, making acquiring them difficult.

### Discontinued CD Media

The following records are still supported by xwax but are no longer available in stores, making acquiring them difficult. However, as it's just a CD it's likely that you can acquire a WAV rip of the timecode from somewhere online.
