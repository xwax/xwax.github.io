**xwax** requires a special media source embedded with a special "tone", known as a *timecode*, to send a signal to xwax telling it how to manipulate the audio file.

## Vinyl Media

- [Scratch Live](https://serato.com/scratchlive) by [Serato](http://www.serato.com/) *(2nd edition or "Performance series" pressings)* **Recommended**
- MixVibes by [Mixvibes](http://www.mixvibes.com/)

Current generation Traktor Scratch records **are not** supported.

### Discontinued Vinyl Media

The following records are still supported by xwax but are no longer available in stores, making acquiring them difficult.

## CD Media

- [Scratch Live Control CD](https://serato.com/controlcd) by [Serato](http://www.serato.com/) *([Free Download](https://serato.com/controlcd/downloads))* **Recommended**

### Discontinued CD Media

The following records are still supported by xwax but are no longer available in stores, making acquiring them difficult. However, as it's just a CD it's likely that you can acquire a WAV rip of the timecode from somewhere online.
