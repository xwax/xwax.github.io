xwax has been packaged for Debian and is available from the main Debian package repositories. If you are running Debian stable (Strech) or oldstable (Jessie), you can execute the following command to install xwax (1.6 for Stretch, and 1.5 for Jessie) and all its dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install xwax
````

Alternatively you can use a graphical package manager such as synaptic.

*Note: the xwax-scan and xwax-import scripts are located under /usr/share/xwax should you wish to replace them with customized versions.*
